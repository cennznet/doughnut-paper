# Doughnut Overview

**Patent Pending**

Blockchain technology has need of powerful, seamless authentication and access control.

This need leads from the success of centralised services in providing excellent user sign-in experiences, most notably in the widespread adoption of Single Sign-On (SSO) models.

The failure of DApps to achieve mainstream adoption persists while the authentication experience lags so far behind centralised applications.

Given the dangers of private key transmission and the high consumer demand for good UX and ideal security, some new system other than signing devices and identity contracts is needed.

`Doughnut`s solve this problem. The concept is simple yet powerful, enabling a classic "centralised" user experience on a trustless, decentralised technologies.

### Naming

Why "`Doughnut`"? It's a take on the "Cookie" and "[Macaroon](https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub41892)" naming convention. `Doughnut`s are decentralised üç©.

## Goals

-   Permissions **MUST**  be given rather than assumed
-   Permissions **MUST** be enforceable for all addresses and contracts
-   Permissions **MUST** protect users as much as possible from malicious applications
-   Doughnuts  **MUST**  be cheap to generate, store, use, transmit and modify
-   Doughnuts **MUST**  be optional, and not modify default blockchain behaviour when not in use
-   Doughnuts  **MUST** be non-viable if stolen
-   Doughnuts  **MUST**  be revokable by the issuer or holder at any time
-   Doughnuts **SHOULD** optionally support off-chain service authentication

## Existing solutions:

Blockchain access control is currently focussed on two solutions:

-   Transactions submitted by applications are signed by a signing device
-   Transactions signed by an application are "executed" by a permissioned identity smart contract

These approaches may be used together in different ways if necessary, but the end result is largely the same.

## What is a `Doughnut`?

A `Doughnut`  is an attenuated permissions `certificate`  issued off-chain from one private key (the  `issuer`), usually to another private key (the `holder`).

On CENNZnet, `Doughnut`s will allow:
* Identity delegation: the `holder` acts as the `issuer,` with a subset of permissions  
* Fee delegation: the `issuer` pays for the fees of the `holder` when specific resources are accessed
* Contract access control: the `holder` may access special features in a smart contract or runtime module
* and more

`Doughnut`s are generated, stored and transmitted off-chain, and may be verified anywhere. This makes them cheap to manage and use.

If a `holder` is specified, the `Doughnut` is only valid when paired with a  `signature` from the  `holder`, helping to mitigate cases where the `certificate`  is stolen.

To recap, `Doughnut`s are cryptographically verifiable access tokens, carrying permissions, generated off-chain.

## Format

A doughnut is binary encoded. It contains a version definition, the version specific encoding of the doughnut, and the certificate signature.

```
<VERSION><PAYLOAD><SIGNATURE>
```

Read more about versions, payload encodings, and signature methods in the doughnut  [format specification](./format.md).


#### Payload:
These fields are common to doughnut certificates.

|Path|Description|Format|Required|
|--|--|--|--|
|`expires`|Expiry UNIX time (TTL)|Number|*|
|`not_before`|UNIX time indicating when the `doughnut`  becomes viable|Number||
|`holder`|`Holder`'s public key|String + Hex|*|
|`issuer`|`Issuer`'s public key|String + Hex|*|
|`permissions`|Permissions object||*|
|`permissions.[domain]`|Permission domains|Any|*|


##### Payload example:
```

	"expires": 1547500527,

	}

## `Doughnut` lifecycle

1.  A  `doughnut` is requested by an application or service from an `issuer`.
	 The requester will become the `holder`  of the  `doughnut`. 
    -   A  `doughnut` request **MUST**  specify:
        -   Requested permissions object (non-empty)
        -   The `holder`'s public key
    -   A  `doughnut` request  **MAY** specify:
        -   The target `issuer`'s public address
            -   If not, this is chosen by the `issuer`  application
    -   The `holder` **MAY**  request many  `doughnut`s, each for a specific transaction
        -   Allows smaller transaction sizes
2.  If approved, the `issuer`  generates the `doughnut`
3.  The `issuer`  transmits the `doughnut`  back to the `holder`
4.  `holder`  may now use the `doughnut`  as the permissions allow
5.  CENNZnet validates the  `doughnut` as a new kind of proof
6.  The `holder`  or the `issuer`  may revoke the `doughnut`  at any time before `expires`
7.  Once `expires`  has passed, the  `doughnut` becomes invalid

#### Validating a `doughnut`
Validation procedures are specified by the `doughnut` [format](./format.md##verification).


#### Executing with a `doughnut`  on CENNZnet

1.  The `doughnut`  bearing extrinsic **MUST**  be valid
2.  The `doughnut`  itself **MUST**  be valid
3.  An extrinsic bearing a  `doughnut`  **MUST** contain a valid non-empty `cennznet`  permissions domain
4.  The  `doughnut.certificate.permissions.cennznet` `permission set` is to be extracted
5.  The extrinsic's specified target and arguments, and all consequent internal transactions **MUST**  be a subset of the `permission set`
