# What are Doughnuts?
At their simplest, Doughnuts are Proofs of Delegation between two or more cryptographic keypairs.
Doughnuts let us prove that one address delegates something to another address.

# What can they do?
Doughnuts let us:

* Easily sign in and out of DApps without using centralised services
* Give untrusted DApps limited permissions on-chain
* Fully permission the public blockchain, achieving optimal user-safety
* Separate who pays the transaction fees from who sent the transaction
* Share access to our accounts and tokens in a protected and managed way
* Create legal contracts or agreements that are written off-chain but execute on-chain
* Improve overall access control for both decentralised services and the centralised services that run alongside them
* And more
